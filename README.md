DNode protocol for PHP
======================

This project implements the [DNode](http://substack.net/posts/85e1bd/DNode-Asynchronous-Remote-Method-Invocation-for-Node-js-and-the-Browser) remote procedure call protocol for PHP. The intent is to enable PHP scripts to act as part of a distributed Node.js cloud, allowing Node to call PHP code, and PHP to call Node code.

You can read more about DNode and PHP in the [introductory blog post](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/dnode-make_php_and_node-js_talk_to_each_other/).

## Installing

dnode-php can be installed using the [Composer](http://packagist.org/) tool. You can either add `dnode/dnode` to your package dependencies, or if you want to install dnode-php as standalone, go to the main directory of this package and run:

    $ wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
    $ php composer.phar install

You can then use the composer-generated autoloader to access the DNode classes:

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

## Running the examples

After installing, you can run the DNode examples located in the examples directory. Each example contains both a client and a server.

For example:

    $ php examples/simple/server.php
    $ php examples/simple/client.php
    n = 3300

The examples have been written to be compatible with the [DNode examples](https://github.com/substack/dnode/tree/master/examples), meaning that you can use any combination of PHP-to-PHP, Node-to-Node, PHP-to-Node, or Node-to-PHP as you wish.

    $ node simple/client.js
    n = 3300

## Current limitations

* Only regular, non-encrypted TCP sockets are supported
* Only one simultaneous connection supported

## Performance

Surprisingly, with simple calls PHP is faster as a DNode client than Node.js. Talking to the _simple example_ DNode server from the dnode repository:

    $ time php examples/simple/client.php
    n = 3300

    real	0m0.067s
    user	0m0.030s
    sys	0m0.030s

The same with a Node.js client:

    $ time node simple/client.js
    n = 3300

    real	0m0.173s
    user	0m0.140s
    sys	0m0.030s

## Development

dnode-php is under heavy development. If you want to participate, please send pull requests.
